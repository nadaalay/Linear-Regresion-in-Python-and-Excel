## Linear Regresion in Python and Excel


### Overview

Excel and Python are the most common tools for data analysis, and several data analysis tasks can be completed using both of them. Here, I created a linear regression model in Python and in Excel. The model was created using [Boston Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/2403-boston-housing-dataset/data) .


### Files Descriptions 
- Data file `Boston_Housing.csv` Boston Housing dataset.
- One notebook file `Linear_Regression.ipynb` which contains the linear regression python code. 
- One Excel file `Boston_Housing_Regression.xls` - which contains the linear regression by excel.
